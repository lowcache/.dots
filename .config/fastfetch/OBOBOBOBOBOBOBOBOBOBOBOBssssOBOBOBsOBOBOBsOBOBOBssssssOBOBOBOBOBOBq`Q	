[1mZinit[0m
       Zinit is a flexible and fast Zshell plugin manager that will allow you to install everything from GitHub and other sites.  Its characteristics are:

       1. Zinit is currently the only plugin manager out there that provides Turbo mode which yields [1m50-80% faster Zsh startup [22m(i.e.: the shell will start up to [1m5 [22mtimes faster!).  Check out a speed comparison with other popular plugin
          managers here (https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/pm-perf-test).

       2. The plugin manager gives [1mreports [22mfrom plugin loadings describing what [1maliases[22m, functions, [1mbindkeys[22m, Zle widgets, zstyles, [1mcompletions[22m, variables, PATH and FPATH elements a plugin has set up.  This allows to quickly familiar‐
          ize oneself with a new plugin and provides rich and easy to digest information which might be helpful on various occasions.

       3. Supported is unloading of plugin and ability to list, (un)install and [1mselectively disable[22m, [1menable [22mplugin’s completions.

       4. The  plugin manager supports loading Oh My Zsh and Prezto plugins and libraries, however the implementation isn’t framework specific and doesn’t bloat the plugin manager with such code (more on this topic can be found on the
          Wiki, in the Introduction (https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/zinit/wiki/INTRODUCTION/#oh_my_zsh_prezto)).

       5. The system does not use $FPATH, loading multiple plugins doesn’t clutter $FPATH with the same number of entries (e.g. 10, 15 or more).  Code is immune to KSH_ARRAYS and other options typically causing compatibility problems.

       6. Zinit supports special, dedicated [1mpackages [22mthat offload the user from providing long and complex commands.  See the zinit-packages repository (https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit-packages) for a growing, complete list
          of Zinit packages and the Wiki page (https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/zinit/wiki/Zinit-Packages/) for an article about the feature.

       7. Also, specialized Zinit extensions — called [1mannexes [22m— allow to extend the plugin manager with new commands, URL-preprocessors (used by e.g.:  zinit-annex-as-monitor  (https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit-annex-as-moni‐
          tor)  annex),  post-install and post-update hooks and much more.  See the zdharma-continuum (https://github.com/zdharma-continuum) organization for a growing, complete list of available Zinit extensions and refer to the Wiki
          article (https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/zinit/wiki/Annexes/) for an introduction on creating your own annex.

[1mZinit Wiki[0m
       The information in this README is complemented by the Zinit Wiki (https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/zinit/wiki/).  The README is an introductory overview of Zinit while the Wiki gives a  complete  information  with  examples.
       Make sure to read it to get the most out of Zinit.

[1mQuick Start[0m
   [1mInstall[0m
   [1mAutomatic Installation (Recommended)[0m
       The easiest way to install Zinit is to execute:

              sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/zinit-install)"

       This will install Zinit in ~/.local/share/zinit/zinit.git.  .zshrc will be updated with three lines of code that will be added to the bottom.  The lines will be sourcing zinit.zsh and setting up completion for command zinit.

       After installing and reloading the shell compile Zinit with zinit self-update.

   [1mManual Installation[0m
       To manually install Zinit clone the repo to e.g. ~/.local/share/zinit/zinit.git:

              ZINIT_HOME="${XDG_DATA_HOME:-${HOME}/.local/share}/zinit/zinit.git"
              mkdir -p "$(dirname $ZINIT_HOME)"
              git clone https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit.git "$ZINIT_HOME"

       and source zinit.zsh from your .zshrc (above compinit (http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html#Initialization)):

              ZINIT_HOME="${XDG_DATA_HOME:-${HOME}/.local/share}/zinit/zinit.git"
              source "${ZINIT_HOME}/zinit.zsh"

       If you place the source below compinit, then add those two lines after the source:

              autoload -Uz _zinit
              (( ${+_comps} )) && _comps[zinit]=_zinit

       Various paths can be customized, see section Customizing Paths.

       After installing and reloading the shell compile Zinit with zinit self-update.

   [1mUsage[0m
   [1mIntroduction[0m
       Click here to read the introduction to Zinit (https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/zinit/wiki/INTRODUCTION/).  It explains basic usage and some of the more unique features of Zinit such as the Turbo mode.  If you’re new to Zinit
       we highly recommend you read it at least once.

   [1mPlugins and snippets[0m
       Plugins can be loaded using load or light.

              zinit load  <repo/plugin> # Load with reporting/investigating.
              zinit light <repo/plugin> # Load without reporting/investigating.

       If you want to source local or remote files (using direct URL), you can do so with snippet.

              zinit snippet <URL>

       Such lines should be added to .zshrc.  Snippets are cached locally, use -f option to download a fresh version of a snippet, or zinit update {URL}.  Can also use zinit update --all to update all snippets (and plugins).

       [1mExample[0m

              # Plugin history-search-multi-word loaded with investigating.
              zinit load zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word

              # Two regular plugins loaded without investigating.
              zinit light zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
              zinit light zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting

              # Snippet
              zinit snippet https://gist.githubusercontent.com/hightemp/5071909/raw/

       [1mPrompt(Theme) Example[0m

       This is powerlevel10k (https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), pure (https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure), starship (https://github.com/starship/starship) sample:

              # Load powerlevel10k theme
              zinit ice depth"1" # git clone depth
              zinit light romkatv/powerlevel10k

              # Load pure theme
              zinit ice pick"async.zsh" src"pure.zsh" # with zsh-async library that's bundled with it.
              zinit light sindresorhus/pure

              # Load starship theme
              zinit ice as"command" from"gh-r" \ # `starship` binary as command, from github release
                        atclone"./starship init zsh > init.zsh; ./starship completions zsh > _starship" \ # starship setup at clone(create init.zsh, completion)
                        atpull"%atclone" src"init.zsh" # pull behavior same as clone, source init.zsh
              zinit light starship/starship

   [1mUpgrade Zinit and plugins[0m
       Zinit can be updated to self-update and plugins to update.

              # Self update
              zinit self-update

              # Plugin update
              zinit update

              # Plugin parallel update
              zinit update --parallel

              # Increase the number of jobs in a concurrent-set to 40
              zinit update --parallel 40

   [1mTurbo and lucid[0m
       Turbo and lucid are the most used options.  Turbo Mode

       Turbo mode is the key to performance.  It can be loaded asynchronously, which makes a huge difference when the amount of plugins increases.

       Usually used as zinit ice wait"<SECONDS>", let’s use the previous example:

              zinit ice wait    # wait is same wait"0"
              zinit load zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word

              zinit ice wait"2" # load after 2 seconds
              zinit load zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word

              zinit ice wait    # also be used in `light` and `snippet`
              zinit snippet https://gist.githubusercontent.com/hightemp/5071909/raw/
              Lucid

       Turbo mode is verbose, so you need an option for quiet.

       You can use with lucid:

              zinit ice wait lucid
              zinit load zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word

       [4m[1mF&A:[24m [22mWhat is ice?

       ice is zinit’s option command.  The option melts like ice and is used only once.  (more: Ice Modifiers)

              zinit snippet OMZL::clipboard.zsh
              zinit snippet OMZL::termsupport.zsh

       [1mTheme[0m

       To use [1mthemes [22mcreated for Oh My Zsh you might want to first source the git library there.

       Then  you  can  use  the themes as snippets (zinit snippet <file path or GitHub URL>).  Some themes require not only Oh My Zsh’s Git [1mlibrary[22m, but also Git [1mplugin [22m(error about current_branch may appear).  Load this Git-plugin as
       single-file snippet directly from OMZ.

       Most themes require promptsubst option (setopt promptsubst in zshrc), if it isn’t set, then prompt will appear as something like: ... $(build_prompt) ....

       You might want to suppress completions provided by the git plugin by issuing zinit cdclear -q (-q is for quiet) – see below [1mIgnoring Compdefs[22m.

       To summarize:

              ## Oh My Zsh Setting
              ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"

              ## Zinit Setting
              # Must Load OMZ Git library
              zinit snippet OMZL::git.zsh

              zinit snippet OMZP::git
              zinit cdclear -q # <- forget completions provided up to this moment

              setopt promptsubst

              # Load Prompt
              zinit snippet OMZT::robbyrussell

              zinit ice pick"async.zsh" src"pure.zsh"

   [1mIce Modifiers[0m
       Following  ice  modifiers  are to be passed (https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/zinit/wiki/Alternate-Ice-Syntax/) to zinit ice ... to obtain described effects.  The word ice means something that’s added (like ice to a drink) –
       and in Zinit it means adding modifier to a next zinit command, and also something that’s temporary because it melts – and this means that the modification will last only for a [1msingle [22mnext zinit command.

       Some Ice-modifiers are highlighted and clicking on them will take you to the appropriate Wiki page for an extended explanation.

       You may safely assume a given ice works with both plugins and snippets unless explicitly stated otherwise.

   [1mUpdating Zinit and Plugins[0m
       To update Zinit issue zinit self-update in the command line.

       To update all plugins and snippets, issue zinit update.  If you wish to update only a single plugin/snippet instead issue zinit update NAME_OF_PLUGIN.  A list of commits will be shown:

       Some  plugins require performing an action each time they’re updated.  One way you can do this is by using the atpull ice modifier.  For example, writing zinit ice atpull'./configure' before loading a plugin will execute ./con‐
       figure after a successful update.  Refer to Ice Modifiers for more information.

       The ice modifiers for any plugin or snippet are stored in their directory in a ._zinit subdirectory, hence the plugin doesn’t have to be loaded to be correctly updated.  There’s one other file created there, .zinit_lstupd –  it
       holds the log of the new commits pulled-in in the last update.

[1mCompletions[0m
   [1mCalling compinit [22mWithout Turbo Mode
       With no Turbo mode in use, compinit can be called normally, i.e.: as autoload compinit; compinit.  This should be done after loading of all plugins and before possibly calling zinit cdreplay.

       The  cdreplay  subcommand  is provided to re-play all catched compdef calls.  The compdef calls are used to define a completion for a command.  For example, compdef _git git defines that the git command should be completed by a
       _git function.

       The compdef function is provided by compinit call.  As it should be called later, after loading all of the plugins, Zinit provides its own compdef function that catches (i.e.: records in an array) the arguments of the call,  so
       that  the loaded plugins can freely call compdef.  Then, the cdreplay ([4mcompdef-replay[24m) can be used, after compinit will be called (and the original compdef function will become available), to execute all detected compdef calls.
       To summarize:

              ZINIT_HOME="${XDG_DATA_HOME:-${HOME}/.local/share}/zinit/zinit.git"
              source "${ZINIT_HOME}/zinit.zsh"

              zinit load "some/plugin"
              ...
              compdef _gnu_generic fd  # this will be intercepted by Zinit, because as the compinit
                                       # isn't yet loaded, thus there's no such function `compdef'; yet
                                       # Zinit provides its own `compdef' function which saves the
                                       # completion-definition for later possible re-run with `zinit
                                       # cdreplay' or `zicdreplay' (the second one can be used in hooks
                                       # like atload'', atinit'', etc.)
              ...
              zinit load "other/plugin"

              autoload -Uz compinit
              compinit

              zinit cdreplay -q   # -q is for quiet; actually run all the `compdef's saved before
                                  #`compinit` call (`compinit' declares the `compdef' function, so
                                  # it cannot be used until `compinit' is ran; Zinit solves this
                                  # via intercepting the `compdef'-calls and storing them for later
                                  # use with `zinit cdreplay')

       This allows to call compinit once.  Performance gains are huge, example shell startup time with double compinit: [1m0.980 [22msec, with cdreplay and single compinit: [1m0.156 [22msec.

   [1mCalling compinit [22mWith Turbo Mode
       If you load completions using wait'' Turbo mode then you can add atinit'zicompinit' to syntax-highlighting plugin (which should be the last one loaded, as their (2 projects, z-sy-h (https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-high‐
       lighting) & f-sy-h (https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting)) documentation state), or atload'zicompinit' to last completion-related plugin.  zicompinit is a function  that  just  runs  autoload  compinit;
       compinit,  created for convenience.  There’s also zicdreplay which will replay any caught compdefs so you can also do: atinit'zicompinit; zicdreplay', etc.  Basically, the whole topic is the same as normal compinit call, but it
       is done in atinit or atload hook of the last related plugin with use of the helper functions (zicompinit,zicdreplay & zicdclear – see below for explanation of the last one).  To summarize:

              ZINIT_HOME="${XDG_DATA_HOME:-${HOME}/.local/share/zinit}"
              source "${ZINIT_HOME}/zinit.zsh"

              # Load using the for-syntax
              zinit wait lucid for \
                  "some/plugin"
              zinit wait lucid for \
                  "other/plugin"

              zinit wait lucid atload"zicompinit; zicdreplay" blockf for \
                  zsh-users/zsh-completions

   [1mIgnoring Compdefs[0m
       If you want to ignore compdefs provided by some plugins or snippets, place their load commands before commands loading other plugins or snippets, and issue zinit cdclear (or zicdclear, designed to be  used  in  hooks  like  at‐
       load''):

              ZINIT_HOME="${XDG_DATA_HOME:-${HOME}/.local/share}/zinit/zinit.git"
              source "${ZINIT_HOME}/zinit.zsh"

              zinit snippet OMZP::git
              zinit cdclear -q # <- forget completions provided by Git plugin

              zinit load "some/plugin"
              ...
              zinit load "other/plugin"

              autoload -Uz compinit
              compinit
              zinit cdreplay -q # <- execute compdefs provided by rest of plugins
              zinit cdlist # look at gathered compdefs

       The cdreplay is important if you use plugins like OMZP::kubectl or asdf-vm/asdf, because these plugins call compdef.

   [1mDisabling System-Wide compinit [22mCall (Ubuntu)
       On  Ubuntu  users might get surprised that e.g. their completions work while they didn’t call compinit in their .zshrc.  That’s because the function is being called in /etc/zshrc.  To disable this call – what is needed to avoid
       the slowdown and if user loads any completion-equipped plugins, i.e. almost on 100% – add the following lines to ~/.zshenv:

              # Skip the not really helping Ubuntu global compinit
              skip_global_compinit=1

[1mZinit Module[0m
       The module is now hosted in its own repository (https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit-module)

[1mHints and Tips[0m
   [1mCustomizing Paths[0m
       Following variables can be set to custom values, before sourcing Zinit.  The previous global variables like $ZPLG_HOME have been removed to not pollute the namespace – there’s single $ZINIT hash instead of 8  string  variables.
       Please update your dotfiles.

              declare -A ZINIT  # initial Zinit's hash definition, if configuring before loading Zinit, and then:

       Hash                   Description
       Field
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       ZINIT[BIN_DIR]         Where Zinit code resides, e.g.: “~/.local/share/zinit/zinit.git”
       ZINIT[HOME_DIR]        Where Zinit should create all working directories, e.g.: “~/.lo‐
                              cal/share/zinit”
       ZINIT[MAN_DIR]         Directory where plugins can store their manpages (atclone"cp -vf
                              myplugin.1 $ZINIT[MAN_DIR]/man1").  If overridden, this directo‐
                              ry  will  not  necessarily  be  used  by man (See #8).  Default:
                              $ZPFX/man

       ZINIT[ZCOMP‐           Path to .zcompdump file, with the file included  (i.e. its  name
       DUMP_PATH]             can be different)
       ZINIT[COMPINIT_OPTS]   Options for compinit call (i.e. done by zicompinit), use to pass

       ZINIT[MUTE_WARNINGS]   If set to 1, then mutes some of the Zinit warnings, specifically

       ZINIT[OPTI‐            If set to 1, then Zinit will skip checking if a Turbo-loaded ob‐

       CESSES]                existing objects (plugins or snippets) to  install  them  before
                              the  first  prompt  – without any delays, during the normal pro‐
                              cessing of zshrc.  This option can give a  performance  gain  of
                              about 10 ms out of 150 ms (i.e.: Zsh will start up in 140 ms in‐
                              stead of 150 ms).
       ZINIT[NO_ALIASES]      If set to 1, then Zinit will not set aliases such as zi or zini

       There is also $ZPFX, set by default to ~/.local/share/zinit/polaris – a directory where software with Makefile, etc.  can be pointed to, by e.g. atclone'./configure --prefix=$ZPFX'.

   [1mNon-GitHub (Local) Plugins[0m
       Use create subcommand with user name _local (the default) to create plugin’s skeleton in $ZINIT[PLUGINS_DIR].  It will be not connected with GitHub repository (because of user name being _local).  To enter the plugin’s directo‐
       ry use cd command with just plugin’s name (without _local, it’s optional).

       If user name will not be _local, then Zinit will create repository also on GitHub and setup correct repository origin.

   [1mExtending Git[0m
       There are several projects that provide git extensions.  Installing them with Zinit has many benefits:

       • all files are under $HOME – no administrator rights needed,

       • declarative setup (like Chef or Puppet) – copying .zshrc to different account brings also git-related setup,

       • easy update by e.g. zinit update --all.

       Below is a configuration that adds multiple git extensions, loaded in Turbo mode, 1 second after prompt, with use of the Bin-Gem-Node (https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit-annex-bin-gem-node) annex:

              zinit as"null" wait"1" lucid for \
                  sbin    Fakerr/git-recall \
                  sbin    cloneopts paulirish/git-open \
                  sbin    paulirish/git-recent \
                  sbin    davidosomething/git-my \
                  sbin atload"export _MENU_THEME=legacy" \
                          arzzen/git-quick-stats \
                  sbin    iwata/git-now \
                  make"PREFIX=$ZPFX install" \
                          tj/git-extras \
                  sbin"git-url;git-guclone" make"GITURL_NO_CGITURL=1" \
                          zdharma-continuum/git-url

       Target directory for installed files is $ZPFX (~/.local/share/zinit/polaris by default).
